* [Statement from President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on the Passing of Former President George H.W. Bush
Issued on: December 1, 2018](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-first-lady-melania-trump-passing-former-president-george-h-w-bush/)

Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away last night.

Through his **essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment** to faith, family, and country, President Bush **inspired** generations of his fellow Americans to public service—to be, in his words, “a thousand points of light” illuminating the greatness, hope, and opportunity of America to the world.

President Bush always found a way to **set the bar higher**.  As a young man, he captained the Yale baseball team, and then went on to serve as the youngest aviator in the United States Navy during the Second World War.  Later in life, he rose to the **pinnacle of American politics** as a Congressman from Texas, **envoy to China**, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President of eight years to President Ronald Reagan, and finally President of the United States.

With sound judgement, common sense, and **unflappable leadership**, President Bush guided our Nation, and the world, to a peaceful and victorious conclusion of the Cold War.  As President, he **set the stage for the decades** of prosperity that have followed.  And through all that he accomplished, he remained humble, following the quiet call to service that **gave him a clear sense of direction**.

Along with his full life of service to country, we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family—especially the love of his life, Barbara.  **His example lives on**, and will continue to **stir future Americans to pursue a greater cause**.  **Our hearts ache with his loss**, and we, with the American people, send our prayers to the entire Bush family, as we honor the life and legacy of 41.

The intersection of the economy and national security is at the forefront of policymakers' minds with the public release of the industrial base review last month that found an alarming number of vulnerabilities throughout critical sections of the industrial base’s supply chain. Join CSIS for a discussion with Dr. Peter Navarro, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy to learn more about the administration’s view of how economic policy supports national security.

* Dear Mr. President:

* I have been privileged to serve as our country’s 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

* I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

* One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, **I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world**. *Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances*. NATO’s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

* Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model — gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic, and security decisions — to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

* My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

* Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department’s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability within the Department.
